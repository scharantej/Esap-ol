 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a Spanish learning website. The website should include the following features:

* A home page with a welcome message and links to other pages
* A page with a list of Spanish words and their English translations
* A page with a quiz to test the user's knowledge of Spanish words
* A page with a contact form for the user to contact the website administrator

## Design

The website will be built using the Flask microframework. The following HTML files will be needed:

* `index.html`: The home page
* `words.html`: The page with the list of Spanish words and their English translations
* `quiz.html`: The page with the quiz
* `contact.html`: The page with the contact form

The following routes will be needed:

* `/`: The home page
* `/words`: The page with the list of Spanish words and their English translations
* `/quiz`: The page with the quiz
* `/contact`: The page with the contact form

The following Python code will be needed to implement the website:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/words')
def words():
    words = [
        ('hola', 'hello'),
        ('adiós', 'goodbye'),
        ('gracias', 'thank you'),
        ('de nada', 'you're welcome'),
        ('¿Cómo te llamas?', 'What is your name?'),
        ('Me llamo', 'My name is'),
        ('¿Cómo estás?', 'How are you?'),
        ('Estoy bien', 'I am fine'),
        ('¿Qué hora es?', 'What time is it?'),
        ('Son las', 'It is')
    ]
    return render_template('words.html', words=words)

@app.route('/quiz')
def quiz():
    questions = [
        ('What is the Spanish word for "hello"?', 'hola'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "goodbye"?', 'adiós'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "thank you"?', 'gracias'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "you're welcome"?', 'de nada'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "What is your name?"', '¿Cómo te llamas?'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "My name is"?', 'Me llamo'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "How are you?"', '¿Cómo estás?'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "I am fine"?', 'Estoy bien'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "What time is it?"', '¿Qué hora es?'),
        ('What is the Spanish word for "It is"?', 'Son las')
    ]
    return render_template('quiz.html', questions=questions)

@app.route('/contact', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def contact():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('contact.html')
    else:
        name = request.form['name']
        email = request.form['email']
        message = request.form['message']
        # Send the email
        return render_template('contact.html', message="Your message has been sent.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Testing

The website can be tested by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The website will then be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
